# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They can be broken into three categories:

<ul>
<li>Creational Patterns for the creation of objects</li>
<li>Structural Patterns to provide relationship between objects</li>
<li>Behavioral Patterns to help define how objects interact</li>
</ul>
